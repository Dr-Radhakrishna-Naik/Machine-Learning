1.1.	What is the business objective?
      Machine learning, in particular, can predict patientsâ€™ survival 
      from their data and can individuate the most important features 
      among those included in their medical records.
1.2.	Are there any constraints?

#the benefits/impact of the solution - in what way does the business (client) benefit from the solution provided?
#The use of survival analysis in medical field has the potential to impact on
# clinical practice, becoming a new supporting tool for physicians when predicting if a heart failure patient will survive or not. Indeed, medical doctors aiming at understanding if a patient will survive after heart failure may focus mainly on serum creatinine and ejection fraction.
