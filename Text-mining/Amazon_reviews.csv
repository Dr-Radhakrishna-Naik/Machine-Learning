0,Akshay D,Great...!,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Very good product...!Gave me 75MBps while copying a 3GB file from Laptop to Pendrive on USB 3.0 port...!My laptop also has USB Type-C port...i did the same test as above...speed was same on the Type-C port...75MBps...but the speed was more consistent than USB 3.0 port...from start to end speed never dropped below 75MBps...!While on USB 3.0 port, speed dropped from 75 to 40-45MBps for 7-8 seconds, then again it goes up to  75MBps, this happened 5-6 times while copying a 3GB file...!My phone also supports Type-C port...i didn't check the speed of file transfer...but it worked perfectly...no problems...!So overall great product...!"
1,Arun,Comes with SanDisk quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pendrive is my 5th SanDisk pendrive and I also bought 7 SanDisk micro sd cards. It is just the brand's quality and service experience that tempt to buy storage devices from SanDisk. Lets come to the performance, however to get fast speed you must have fast USB ports like USB 3.1 you can get enough speed through 2.0 ports as well. After trusting  SanDisk for so many years, I will definately recommend this pendrive."
2,CustomerComment,Simple and easy to use. A good purchase.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The USB drive is small, has two sided male ports (USB A and USB C) which can slide out of the USB casing.Note: USB A is the general keyboard and mouse USB connector and USB C is apple's charging cable connector which now a days is common in most smartphones.The USB drive becomes hot when being used on USB C port for large transfers and is common. It can be plugged into mobile phones which has C type charging cable. The actual storage that you would get would be 114 GB. It would never be 128 GB as the rest is occupied by the drivers to run the USB drive. The drive supports exFAT (default) and NTFS file systems only.The actual transfer rate depends on a lot of factors like the type and generation of USB connector, the type of storage, processor, motherboard, etc.Transfer rates are good. I've tested it and shared the results below. The transfer rates may have gone down to 20 MBps in case of 50 MBps for HDD. The 600 MBps mark for HDD (3) went down to 80 MBps and remained constant.1. USB A 2.0 (copying to and from SATA HDD) - maximum transfer rate up to 16 MBps2. USB A 2.0 (Coping to and from NVME or SATA SSD) - maximum transfer rate up to 200 MBps3. USB A 3.0 (Copying to and from SATA HDD) - maximum transfer rate up to 600 MBps  20 MBps4. USB A 3.0 (Copying to and from NVME SSD) - maximum transfer rate up to 600 MBps and 50 MBps respectively5. USB C 3.2 (Copying to and from SATA HDD) - maximum transfer rate up to 100 MBps and 50 MBbps respectively6. USB C 3.2 (Copying to and from NVME SSD) - maximum transfer rate up to 130 MBps and 50 MBps respectively"

4,Aswin A,Good device,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful device, very easy to use, just plug it. All my type C port, mobile phone, instantly recognised it. Now its really very convenient for me to transfer data from one phone to another, specially large files. It's maintained 30Mbps speed during data transfer, which is OK.Overall all its a good product if you want to transfer large amount of data from phone to phone or from phone to computer.Nice and easy to use device. For day to day use."
5,Ask,A nice purchase!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always buy SanDisk pendrive as they are the most trusted and can never go wrong. This pen drive was for day to day task and is doing well till now.But the writing speed for me is bit low when using the USB 3.0, it's decent if I use the USB c type. Not tested yet with smartphones but it works perfectly fine for my laptop.Biggest plus point of this pen drive is the storage, pricing is decent and for me to get this kind of storage in a pen drive so that I take this in my pocket wherever I go was good for me."
6,Abhishek Kumar,Reliable and sturdy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is sturdy and stylish. Size is comfortable to use. Regarding the performance, I am using it for my redmi 7 pro, no issues. Transfer speed is okay for me. I didn't check the technical aspects about speed and other details, but to me this solves my purpose of transferring photos from phone and vice versa. I even bought the second one of the same version to my friend, he too is happy with this pendrive."
7,Sam,A bridge between PC & phone & TV & many more.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before buying it for me, I actually gifted one for my niece. I saw how useful it was. Then I got my own.In this smartphone world, we need multipurpose devices/gadgets. So that life makes easy.Apart from regular USB, type C is very handy, especially if you use both, PC/laptop and phone equally. Before, I used to have otg cable.SanDisc did a good job. I always had other brand pendrives, but now there's a reason to go for this. Totally worth a buy."
8,Rangan,"Small, fast, great build quality and supports almost all Operating Systems.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I mainly use this with my IPad Pro. Works amazingly well, I got around 80 mb/s Read speed and about 40-60 mb/s write speed. Way smaller than I thought and great quality as expected from SanDisk. Although if itâ€™s plugged in for a long time it does heat up a little but nothing to worry about. This is with no doubt the best flash drive Iâ€™ve ever used.Highly recommended to IPad Pro / Mac ðŸ’» Users."
9,Naveen,Perfect for MacBook Pro - is fast and reliable.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased it for use with my MacBook Pro 15, has decent read and write speeds - better than most of the competition. Has been working reliably - and changes smoothly between USB-C and USB-A. Iâ€™m not a fan of the slide mechanism of these kind of pen drives though, but I knew what I was getting into and preferred the convenience of it. All in all - you canâ€™t go wrong with this purchase."
