0,Highly recommended,5,Received this ac on next day when I ordered...Delivery guy is very much descent 5 star for him...Same day I got a call from Samsung for installation and next day they installed but they charged too much for installation around Rs5000 it's just because they provide extra Cooper wire...but they are very much professional and they guide very gently whatever I asked them...5 star for them also...Now come to the AC details...it's very good purchase I had...just 2 days I used it.Design is not u...READ MORE

4,Mind-blowing purchase,5,"Overall it's a good product in this price point. You don't get  an inverter AC on this price from a renowned brand. Pros- 1. Brand value2. Inverter AC at this price point3. Excellent cooling, I m using it in a 100sq.ft room - 1 Ton capacity and it's really effective4. Eco mode is good and saves energy specially if you  keep the AC on for entire night5. 10 yrs compressor warranty6.  Prompt service from Samsung7.

5,Wonderful,5,"Day 2 after installationPro'sBest for 31.5 GrandProsServices Center in almost all cities.( A must think too keep in mind, if one lives in any semi-urban.Minimal and best Cooling is good after few secondsConsLook is very minimal and straight forwardIt take some extra seconds to starts cooling but once it starts, works flawlessly fine.One big con that I thought would not bother me was side swing, It great though but side swing adds up additional benefits.One thing to keep in mi...READ MORE"
6,Useless product,5,"Not too good when it comes to cooling, takes almost 30 - 45 minutes to maintain an ideal temperature in the room, plus makes too much noise while operating, eco mode is worst in all way. Better to use a fan than this eco mode. Worst performance! Nothing good in the ac just an average product and I am here talking about the 1 ton 3 star AR12TY3QBBUNNA model.Installation was not good they were in a hurry and still not clear about whether to use a stabilizer with this ac or not as Samsung supp...READ MORE"
7,Terrific,5,Thanks Flipkart & Mostly Samsung.. üëç For this best product opportunity.. It is a valuable product. You can go for it.. Delivery Service is very good. & Installation also Very Good Service from Authorised Samsung Service in the next morning after my product got delivered. In cooling matter it gives sufficient cooling to your entire room. Till now all is well hope for the best in near future. It's already 4 days passed from my AC installation.READ MORE
8,Terrific purchase,4,"Very nice AC from Samsung. Blindly go for it as it has most service centres compared to other brands. The installation guy came the very next day after delivery and did a clean work. The outdoor unit was kept on the terrace on request. He charged me 2399 for installation which is also very less compared to other brands that too for extended outdoor unit. Coming to cooling, the AC is very fast in chilling and stays quiet in sleep mode. Not even a fan sound in that mode. Samsung claims that the...READ MORE"
9,Nice product,5,I am giving this review after using it for 1 month and i have found that it was a great deal to invest in a big company everything was great from the delivery to the installation. keeping the ac on 24¬∞ in the night hours is more than enough to make a room cool (120sqft) that too within 2-3 hours. One thing that i would recommend is just use the 3m pipe that is being provided don't use extra as it effects the efficiency of the product and cooling will decreaseREAD MORE
