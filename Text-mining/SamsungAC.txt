['\nGreat service by samsung. Installation on same day of delivery. Great work samsung\n', '\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Purchased this from a local retailer, my room size is 170 sqft. AC take 7-10 minutes to cool every corner. Convertible options are yet to test.\n', '\n4 way swing is missing. Title is misleading. Otherwise okay.\n', '\nThere are 1500 per Ac installation charges along with that wire charges, the wires are too small to actually install it, additional stand charges then nobody is even bothered to pick up phone on samsung customer care. Why is it not included in the price above why are you charging the customers extra for this .. this is pathetic, just trying to get more money out of the customers pocket. Ridiculous\n', "\nI am not happy with the product performance, service not good. Overall it's a headache Samsung AC\n", '\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0AC is good. Delivered with pakage torn but no damage. Installation is done after 2 days of continuous phone calls. Samsung Installation team is professional and does their work. They left some portion of cooling copper tube exposed without insulation material. You need to pay 1420 installation fee plus stand if needed. Stand cost is 800+Tax. Before installation of AC make sure you have proper wiring done on your house. you should have atleast 2.5mm wire connected from main electric box. Cools the room in 10 mins. The copper tube length is 10+10ft appx., extra tubing need to be purchased. Sound level is minimal only but there is lot of vibration when compressor runs. coming to energy It draws around 4 to 6 amps when compressor runs and after cooling is achieved it draws less than 1 amp current. 5 in 1 feature is good. It draws lot of moisture out of the room so getting simple room moisturizer is needed. The Biggest CON is THERE IS NO HORIZONTAL SWING. The remote button is empty for Horizontal swing and you need to manually adjust the swing everytime with chair to climb to AC unit. So far good experience. But for this price range there are more good options available Incl this AC.\n', '\nThis product is very very poor multiple problems facing1. Properly not cooling issue2. Getting so much noise indoor3.I facing different problems\n', '\nNice cooling\n', '\nAmazon did not ship the product with copper pipes which is necessary for installing and proper working. When contacted they asked me to purchase it from somewhere else and promised to reimburse the amount. I did purchase the copper pipes using cash from another physical store and when asked for a reimbursement to my bank account, they instead insisted they would provide the refund only to my amazon pay account which I will have to use only on amazon for the pathetic service they provided. How does that even make sense? However, they were ready to issue the refund to my bank account if I returned the product. Very good logic that is. Very nice amazon, some policies you have here. Please make this more transparent for your customers so that they can avoid going through this ordeal.On a side note, the product works fine, no complains so far.\n', '\nProduct is good. But installation team is non professional.\n']
